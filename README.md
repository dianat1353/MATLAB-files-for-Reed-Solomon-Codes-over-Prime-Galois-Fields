# MATLAB-files-for-Reed-Solomon-Codes-over-Prime-Galois-Fields
This is MATLAB files to implement encoders and decoders for Reed-Solomon codes over Prime Galois Fields. We focused on Fermat  Prime numbers so we implemented codecs for GF(2^m+1)
These files are good for whom intending simulate Reed-Solomon Codes over GF(257), GF(17) and GF(65537) in MATLAB. That is GF(p) where p is a Fermat Prime. Both systematic and non-systematic codes are implemented. Please see the following paper for details.
